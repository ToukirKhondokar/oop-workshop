# Online Movie Stream
An online movie streaming platform offers a large library of films. Users can browse the available movies, add them to their watchlist, and rate the ones they've seen. The system keeps track of each user's watch history and recommends similar films based on their preferences.

# Library Management System

# Smart Home Automation  
Implemented a modular Smart Home System using interfaces and OOP principles  

- Defined 'ISmartDevice' as the base interface for all smart devices.  
- Created specific interfaces: 'ILightControl', 'ITemperatureControl', 'ISecurityCamera, and 'ISmartLock' for device-specific behaviors.  
- Implemented smart device classes ('SmartLight', 'SmartThermostat', 'SecurityCamera', 'SmartLock') with proper encapsulation.  
- Developed 'SmartHomeAutomation' to manage multiple devices, allowing batch operations like turning all devices on/off.  
- Added a 'Main' function to demonstrate system functionality with different smart devices.  

This implementation follows SOLID principles, ensuring scalability and maintainability.
