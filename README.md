## Online Movie Stream
An online movie streaming platform offers a large library of films. Users can browse the available movies, add them to their watchlist, and rate the ones they've seen. The system keeps track of each user's watch history and recommends similar films based on their preferences.

 The library has a catalog of books with details such as title, author, and availability.Members can borrow books, and the library tracks the due dates for each loan.
